## Tizen .NET

Tizen .NET is an exciting new way to develop applications for the Tizen operating system, running on 50 million Samsung devices, including TVs, wearables, mobile phones, and many other IoT devices around the world.

The existing Tizen frameworks are either C-based with no advantages of a managed runtime, or HTML5-based with fewer features and lower performance than the C-based solution. With Tizen .NET, you can use the C# programming language and the Common Language Infrastructure standards, and have benefits from a managed runtime for faster application development and code execution that is efficient and secure.


## TizenFX API

TizenFX API allows applications to call into platform-specific functionality from the shared code. This functionality enables Xamarin.Forms applications to do things a native application can do, without causing the portable part of the application to become littered with operating system-specific details.

The following table specifies the API Level supported by each version of the Tizen platform:

| API Level   | Target Framework | Target Platform | API Reference   |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| API Level 8 | tizen80          | Tizen vNext     | https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/master/ |
| API Level 7 | tizen70          | Tizen 5.5 M3    | https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API7/   |
| API Level 6 | tizen60          | Tizen 5.5 M2    | https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API6/   |
| API Level 5 | tizen50          | Tizen 5.0 M2    | https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API5/   |
| API Level 4 | tizen40          | Tizen 4.0 M2    | https://samsung.github.io/TizenFX/API4/   |
