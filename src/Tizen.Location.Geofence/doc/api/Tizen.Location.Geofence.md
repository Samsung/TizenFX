## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> All Geofence APIs have been deprecated since Tizen 8.0 (API Level 11) which means they are planned to be removed after two releases.

This API provides functions to set the gofence with a geopoint, MAC address of Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth address.
Also, notifications on events like changing in service status are provided.

There are two kinds of places and fences:
- Public places and fences that are created by the MyPlace application can be used by all applications.
- Private places and fences that are created by the specified application can be used by the same application.

Notifications can be received about the following events:
- Zone in when a device enters a specific area.
- Zone out when a device exits a specific area.
- Results and errors for each event requested to geofence module.

The Geofence manager has the following properties:
- The geofence type.
- The status.
- 'Service state change' callback
